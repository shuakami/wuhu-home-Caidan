## Help

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> I'm stuck at the installation step (1). Can you help me?</dt>

On Windows computers, you need to open a window called "Command Prompt," which is like a small blackboard.
- How to open Command Prompt: Click the "Start" button -> Type "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the search box -> Click on the "CommandPrompt" program that appears.

Then, type in the Command Prompt: ```git clone https://github.com/shuakami/wuhu-home-Caidan.git``` This command is like telling the Git assistant, "Hey, go fetch the project's code repository!" After pressing the Enter key, Git will start working, and after completion, you will find a copy of the code in the current folder.</dt>

  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> What about on a Mac?</dt>

- To open Terminal on a Mac: Click the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen -> "Go" -> "Utilities" -> Find and open "Terminal".
- After opening the Terminal, type in the same command:
  ```git clone https://github.com/shuakami/wuhu-home-Caidan.git```
- Pressing the Enter key will also get Git to bring you the treasure of codes from the internet. Make sure you've installed it first.

 <dt><strong>Q:</strong> How about for Linux users?</dt>

- Usually, you can find an icon called ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù in the taskbar or launcher, clicking it will open it.
- If you can't find it, you can also press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` as a shortcut to open Terminal.
- In the opened terminal window, enter the same command: ```git clone https://github.com/shuakami/wuhu-home-Caidan.git```
- After pressing the Enter key to execute the command, Git will clone the repository to your Linux machine.


<em>Note: Phones generally do not support cloning Git repositories directly this way, and it requires special apps or transferring from a computer after cloning there.</em>

  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> Where is the tutorial for modifying the source code, and when will it be available?</dt>

Regarding this question, the tutorial will likely be rushed out by the end of March, so stay tuned.
